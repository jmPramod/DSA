// 1. Write a JavaScript function to calculate the sum of two numbers
// 2. Write a JavaScript program to find the maximum number in an array
// 3. Write a JavaScript function to check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
// 4. Write a JavaScript program to reverse a given string.
// 5. Write a JavaScript function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array with only the even numbers.
// 6. Write a JavaScript program to calculate the factorial of a given number.
// 7. Write a JavaScript function to check if a given number is prime
// 8. Write a JavaScript program to find the largest element in a nested array.
// 9. Write a JavaScript function that returns the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms.
// 10. Write a JavaScript program to convert a string to title case (capitalize the first letter of each word).

// 2. Write a function that takes an array of objects and a key, and returns a new array sorted based on the values of that key in ascending order.
// 3. Implement a deep clone function in JavaScript that creates a copy of a nested object or array without any reference to the original.
// 4. Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given number.
// 5. Implement a function that takes two sorted arrays and merges them into a single sorted array without using any built-in sorting functions.
// 6. Write a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring case.
// 7. Create a JavaScript class for a linked list with methods to insert a node at the beginning, end, or at a specific position, and to delete a node from a given position.
// 8. Implement a function that flattens a nested array in JavaScript, converting it into a single-level array.
// 9. Write a function that determines if two strings are anagrams of each other
// 10. Create a JavaScript function that returns the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number, utilizing memoization for optimized performance.

// 2. Implement a function to reverse a string without using the built-in reverse() method.
// 3. Given an array of numbers, write a function to find the largest and smallest numbers in the array.
// 4. Write a function that takes an array of integers as input and returns a new array with only the unique elements.
// 5. Implement a function to find the factorial of a given number.
// 8. Given a string, write a function to count the occurrences of each character in the string.

// 9. Implement a function to remove duplicates from an array.
// 10. Write a function that sorts an array of numbers in ascending order.
